  "body": "### the idea\r\nRaspiremote is a java based Program intended to run on a Raspberry PI to control Devices such as TV's, Radios, Speakers, etc. via IP Control and/or Infrared. How to setup your Raspberry PI with an IR Transmitter is explained here [link will follow]. The Raspiremote Software provides an Interface which allows you to control your devices via REST Service calls, IFTT, or through smart voice-enabled devices such as Amazon Echo or Google Home. If your Raspberry PI is behind a Firewall and port forwarding can not be enabled Raspuremote will work together with rss (RaspiRemoteServer) [link will follow]. rss is a WebApplication, running in the internet on openshift and will provide the same REST Services and forward requests to the Raspiremote client through a WebSocket.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe Author is Christian Pressler @chpressler.\r\nIf you want to contribute please contact me.\r\n",
